# Project: Flexbox Landing Page

This is the second project of the Odin Camp curriculum. The goal of this project was to create a landing page using  the flexbox layout.

I learnt how to use flexbox layout model to create a responsive and flexible layout for a landing page. I also learnt how to use media queries to apply styles based on the size of the viewport.
